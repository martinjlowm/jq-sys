Generated bindings for [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) 1.6.

The bindings were generated by running:

```
$ git submodule update --init --remote
$ bindgen modules/jq/src/jq.h -o src/bindings.rs
```

This was done using the `bindgen` crate, which is available via
`cargo install`.

Note that libjq is provided by the [jq-src] crate, which requires `gcc`,
`autoreconf`, `make`, etc in your `PATH` to build.
